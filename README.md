reuirements : Visual Studio 16 (2019), opencv , cmake , dlib.
Here I have created a .py file to calculate the speed of the car and an xml file which stores the trained model of car.
When a video of car(s)  passing is given as input ,
this program detects the car(s) in that video using xml file and 
calculate the speed of car(s) in that video using .py file and displays it.
